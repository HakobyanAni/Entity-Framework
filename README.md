# [Entity-Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/)

Entity Framework is an open-source ORM framework for .NET applications supported by Microsoft. <b>Object Relation Mapping</b> is a way to map your relational database to logical objects in the programming language which comes to an advantage to reduce the lines of code to implement a business process and provides some sort of persistency to the objects. <b>Entity Framework</b> enables developers to work with data using objects of domain specific classes without focusing on the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored. With the Entity Framework, developers can work at a higher level of abstraction when they deal with data, and can create and maintain data-oriented applications with less code compared with traditional applications.
<p> <i>Official Definition:</i> “Entity Framework is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.”
</p>
EF mainly allows <i>three types of approaches</i> related to this use. They are Database-First, Code-First and Model-First.
<p>  The following figure illustrates where the Entity Framework fits into your application.</p>
